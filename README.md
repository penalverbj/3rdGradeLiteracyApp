# Pitch
It is a sad truth that many young students lack access to resources that would enable them to
grow and learn. The National Center for Education Statistics says that 14% of children ages 3-18
donâ€™t have internet access at home, an astonishing amount considering the circumstances in the
world today. The creation of an iOS application, which can function regardless of internet
connection, is an elegant solution to this problem. Even though these students may not have
access to the internet, many of them do have access to a phone or tablet.

Our team is proposing an application built with the experience of the student in mine. We will
ensure that the interface is fun and engaging for the younger students while also making it very
easy to understand and navigate so that the students are able to do the work on their own. We
will report results from the students' work and quizzes to the Data Analytics Platform, so that
their progress can be monitored by their parents or instructors.

We have experience building applications for both iOS and for the web, with several of our
members having completed their own applications. We also have experience in both ethnography
and UI/UX research. With this we have the ability to engage with kids, understand their needs,
and perfectly tailor the application to them. We will connect with, interview, and test with our
target audience to ensure the goals for the app are met. Our team has the technical knowledge to
make this project a reality, but more importantly, we truly believe this is a worthwhile and
impactful project. We aim to make this application the best of its class in order to give young
kids the practice they need. We will work with the client every step of the way to ensure a
beautifully-designed application that will succeed in helping as many students as possible.
