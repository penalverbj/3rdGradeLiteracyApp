# Hear a Tale - Contractions for Third Graders - Team 0353

**By: Nathan Davenport, Chaselyn Baca, Parisha Reddy, Andrew Jeffers, Jose Penalver Bartolome**

# Pitch
It is a sad truth that many young students lack access to resources that would enable them to
grow and learn. The National Center for Education Statistics says that 14% of children ages 3-18
don’t have internet access at home, an astonishing amount considering the circumstances in the
world today. The creation of an iOS application, which can function regardless of internet
connection, is an elegant solution to this problem. Even though these students may not have
access to the internet, many of them do have access to a phone or tablet.

Our team is proposing an application built with the experience of the student in mine. We will
ensure that the interface is fun and engaging for the younger students while also making it very
easy to understand and navigate so that the students are able to do the work on their own. We
will report results from the students' work and quizzes to the Data Analytics Platform, so that
their progress can be monitored by their parents or instructors.

We have experience building applications for both iOS and for the web, with several of our
members having completed their own applications. We also have experience in both ethnography
and UI/UX research. With this we have the ability to engage with kids, understand their needs,
and perfectly tailor the application to them. We will connect with, interview, and test with our
target audience to ensure the goals for the app are met. Our team has the technical knowledge to
make this project a reality, but more importantly, we truly believe this is a worthwhile and
impactful project. We aim to make this application the best of its class in order to give young
kids the practice they need. We will work with the client every step of the way to ensure a
beautifully-designed application that will succeed in helping as many students as possible.

# Install Guide 

## Pre-requisites: 

To be able to run and modify the code, you musthave the following installed in your computer 

* React Native. You can follow the directions on the React Native website, linked below, for installing it on your computer 

    * https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup  

    * Make sure you are on the “React Native CLI Quickstart” tab and to do exactly as the instructions say 

* NPM. Npm is used for installing packages and dependencies in React Native. You can use the link below to install npm 

    * https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm  

## Installation/Download: 

* To download the code simply clone our GitHub repository or save the folder from the files we give you into the C: drive in your computer 

    * https://github.com/penalverbj/3rdGradeLiteracyApp  

* Make sure not to alter the folder structure or change the names of any files 

* You can use any code editor (Atom, Sublime, Visual Studio, Notepad++, etc.) to open the code and edit it 

## Dependent Libraries: 

Our React Native project requires many packages and libraries. To install them, follow the following steps. 

1. Open command prompt on your computer 

1. Navigate to the project folder (./WordPhonics) 

1. Once you are in the folder, run the following command to install all the packages and libraries used in our code 

    1. npm install 

1. Prompts will come up asking if you want to install these libraries, asking for audit permission, and other things. Click accept or yes to make sure they get installed. 

1. None of the libraries we are using are harmful to your computer in any way 

1. Installing all the dependencies might take a while 

1. When they are all installed the app is ready to run 

## Run Instructions: 

1. Read the “Environment Setup” instructions on the React Native website to set up the Android or iOS environment to run the app 

    1. https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup  

    1. You can only set up an iOS environment if you have a Mac 

1. Once the Android and/or iOS environment is set up, open the command prompt and navigate to the project folder (./WordPhonics) 

1. When you are at the folder, run the following command, depending on the enviornment operating system, to launch the app 

    1. react-native run-android (Android) 

    1. react-native run-ios (iOS) 

1. It will take a while for the command to complete, but when it does you will see the app on the virtual phone on your computer 

## Troubleshooting: 

* The most troublesome part is installing React Native. To avoid any issues, make sure you read the instructions on the website very well and do exactly as they say 

* If certain libraries are not installing:  

    * Check if they prompts came up on the console saying that some packages require additional packages to be installed. If so, install those necessary packages 

    * Update your npm to the latest version 

        * https://docs.npmjs.com/try-the-latest-stable-version-of-npm  

    * Update React Native to the latest version 

        * https://reactnative.dev/docs/upgrading
